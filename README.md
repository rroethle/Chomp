# Chomp
Chomp is our Survey Generator

To use chomp you must follow the steps below after download files to a location on your desktop:

1) Download MongoDB. (https://www.mongodb.org/) and follow the download instructions from their site.
2) Run mongod.exe
3) Run mongo.exe
4) Open a new command prompt window and navigate to the directory where the "chomp" files have been downloaded and open app.py from this command prompt window.
5) Check the command prompt window to see what local host address it has opened for you. (mine was 5000)
6) In a web browser, navigate to http://localhost:5000/ (or whatever port number it has opened for you)

You will now be able to generate surveys!
