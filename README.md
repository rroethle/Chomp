Chomp is our Survey Generator

To use chomp you must follow the steps below after download files to a location on your desktop:<br>

1) Download MongoDB. (https://www.mongodb.org/) and follow the download instructions from their site.<br>
2) Run mongod.exe<br>
3) Run mongo.exe<br>
4) Open a new command prompt window and navigate to the directory where the "chomp" files have been downloaded and open app.py from this command prompt window.<br>
5) Check the command prompt window to see what local host address it has opened for you. (mine was 5000)<br>
6) In a web browser, navigate to http://localhost:5000/ (or whatever port number it has opened for you)<br>
